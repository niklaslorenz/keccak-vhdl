Requirements:
    - Pre padded and formatted data in memory
    - Arguments:
        - $"start address"
        - $"block count"
        - $"result address"

- Init atoms: 1 cycle
    - Trigger Init signal
    - Atom Index setup

- Setup AGU for atom 0 with $"start address", data width 8 and stride 16
- Setup AGU for atom 1 with ยง"start address"+8, data width 8 and stride 16
- Wait for atoms to emit "ready"
- For b in 1 to $"block count"
    - Trigger Read signal
    - For i in 1 to 16
        - read from memory and forward to atoms
        - generate next address in agu
    - wait for atoms to emit "ready"

- Trigger write signal
- setup AGU with $"result address", data width 4 and stride 4
- i <= 0
- while i < 4
    - if transmission_active from atom_0 is active
        - write transmission data from atom_0 to memory
        - generate next address in agu
        - i++
        


-- NOTE: maybe add a transmission_active input signal into the atom so it can adapt to the transmission pattern while reading?
